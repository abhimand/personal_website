~In-Progress~

*06/17/2020* My laptop motherboard just got fried and I am currently out of town, so project will have to be on hold for now until I get a new laptop.
*06/20/2020* I opened up my laptop and did a reset with the mother board by disconnecting and reconnecting the CMOS battery, and it seemed to have worked. But now the laptop does turn on sometimes and other times it does not at all. I ordered a new laptop and will continue project whenever possible with the state of my current laptop.
*06/27/2020* I now have my new laptop up and running, will still need a few days to settle in but can now continue with project with ease.

~In-Progress~

*06/17/2020* My laptop motherboard just got fried and I am currently out of town, so project will have to be on hold for now until I get a new laptop.

*06/20/2020* I opened up my laptop and did a reset with the mother board by disconnecting and reconnecting the CMOS battery, and it seemed to have worked. But now the laptop does turn on sometimes and other times it does not at all. I ordered a new laptop and will continue project whenever possible with the state of my current laptop.

*06/27/2020* I now have my new laptop up and running, will still need a few days to settle in but can now continue with project with ease.

*07/03/2020* Taking a pause or will be working less on this project. I have linked it to my Linkedin and Instagram. So far the only content is the resume, but I hope to add some food blogs and when travel blogs in 6-8 months from now when COVID has gone down, hopefully. I could monetize my blogs on medium, though I would like link the specific pages or just make it available to everyone. Will need to look into it.

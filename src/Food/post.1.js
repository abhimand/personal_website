# Starting with home: Fajitas

#### June 20, 2020 by [Abhishek](/)

Chicken fajitas is a customizable and easy-to-make healthy meal. 
You can add your own custom spices, choose your own peppers, decide
what tortillas you can use, change up the protein - there's a lot 
of customization. Colors can create an appetizing and vibrant look on 
any plate. Toppings can be limitless with salsa, refried beans, or guacamole.

## Ingredients 
- Bell Peppers 
- Onions
- Chicken Breasts or Thighs
- Fajita Seasoning
- Jalapenos - This is optional, you can also use serrano peppers

## Process

1.   Prep and cut your chicken and peppers in long slices (use 
however much you want). This makes it easier to layout on your 
tacos in my opinion.
2.   Marinade your chicken ideally for 30 minutes up to 12 hours. 
3.   Toss your chicken in a skillet. Cook them till they're all white, 
scoot them to half of the skillet, and place your onions and peppers 
on the other half. Once your peppers and onion soften up, mix it all 
up until the moisture evaporates from the skillet.
